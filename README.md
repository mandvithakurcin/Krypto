##Introduction 
This project is aimed at developing a Crypto Blockchain Application. This Blockchain
Application System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout
the Net and can be accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application
will help the client for sending and receiving Ethereum through the blockchain
network, A blockchain is a distributed, verifiable data store. It works by marrying
public-key cryptography with the Nobel concept of proof-of-work.Each transaction in the
blockchain is signed by the rightful owner of the resource being traded in the
transaction. When new coins (resources) are created they are assigned to an owner.
##Conclusion
The project was designed in such a way that future modifications can be done easily.
The following conclusions can be deduced from the development of the project.

1. We can provide users with the Customer Support System.
2. We can also create a sign in, sign up, sign out function into our system.
3. Can also make Customers Post their View on Websites.
4. The System has adequate scope for modification in future if it is necessary.
5. In the future we are going to add a crypto market into our system.
6. We will also add a crypto exchange feature into our system.
